## Results

After attending this event with other URJC students, [Figueron](https://github.com/f1gueron) and I could manage to solve only 2 of the 22 flags of this CTF. This CTF was really hard and frustrating but I see it as an oportunity to learn more.

I wrote my own writeup about one of the challenges [here](great-old-talisman-writeup).
